# Project Description:
This was my final project for the class Foundations of Data Science II. I tested algorithms to classify tumors as malignant or benign, 
and then reported on which algorithm performed the best.

## File descriptions:
- **FinalProject.ipynb:** Initial notebook containing instructions for the project and my experimentation.
- **FinalProjectReport.ipynb:** Final notebook comparing 2 machine learning algorithms and recommending the best algorithm for classifying tumors.
