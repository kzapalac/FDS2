# Foundations of Data Science II
I took the course Foundations of Data Science II in Spring 2023. In this course, I advanced my knowledge of essential python libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn. I also learned how to perform data wrangling, create intricate figures, and analyze data using machine learning.
This repository contains all my classwork, homework, and the final project for this course.
